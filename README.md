## Overview

This is a static, informational webpage built to display popular anime titles grouped into categories such as action, family, child, and more. Each anime is presented with a title, a brief description, and a “Download” button. The layout emphasizes clarity, efficiency, and ease of navigation.

## Features

- **Category Sections** – Organizes anime by genre like Action, Family, Child, etc.
- **Anime Cards** – Each display includes:
  - **Title** (e.g., *Naruto*, *One-Punch Man*, *Kakegurui*)
  - **Description** (synopsis displayed beneath the title)
  - **Download** button for each item
- **Minimalistic Design** – Focused on content clarity and ease of use.

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** – For semantic structure and content layout.  
- **CSS / JavaScript (optional)** – For styling and potential interactivity (not present in the live snippet).
